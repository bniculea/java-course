- Exercises
- Homework exercises

## Recap previous session
- What is a `for` instruction? How does it help?
- What is the difference between a `for` and a `while`?
- Can you substitute a `for` loop with a `while` loop?



## Exercises
- Note: each exercises will be first solved using the `for` instruction and then using the `while` instruction such that you will get familiar with both of them

1. Given `n` natural numbers, create a JAVA program which will compute the root mean square ( media patratica) of them.
    - Note: the formula for this is described in the image below:

    - Solution:
        1. `while`:
            ```JAVA
            ```


## Homework exercises


## Guidelines
- Try to redo each of the class exercises, both with while and for instructions. Then, compare your solution with the one provided in our session
    - Do not forget that there are multiple solution to a problem, thus, if your solution differ than the one described, it is NOT wrong.
